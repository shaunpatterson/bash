This modification allows users to map ctrl+r to a graphical reverse menu lookup of the previous commands


I have created a new function map

rl_find to "graphical-search-history"  

to be used in the users ~/.inputrc

I have used the ncurses library to implement a graphical history lookup.  I'm not sure if this is the best way to attack this problem.  Also, I'm not sure if this functionality should be in the readline 
library or moved out to the Bash sources.  Ideally I'd like to implement a drop down box completion mechanism like Firefox uses in the address bar or the ^N^P completion in Vim7.
